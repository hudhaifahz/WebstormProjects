## Lessons learned

I let this deliverable slide, and it shows. Better time management is the real solution to all of this, so that we 
have enough time to properly debug everything without it being a rush.

That being said, splitting up the work the way we did worked decently well, and I feel like everybody did a decent 
job of getting what was assigned to them done.
